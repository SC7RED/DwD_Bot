# DwD_Bot
This is my attempt to make a discord bot that I can use.
This project is for fun and I just want to learn more about python.
Hopefully when I'm Skilled enough I can try to become a bot moderator for a discord server.
Also if you use my bot make sure to use the command import discord in the cmd, terminal, or whatever it is for mac users.(Sorry I don't know :P)
